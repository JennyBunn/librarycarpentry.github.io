What is Library Carpentry?
--------------------------

Library Carpentry is made **by librarians, for librarians** to help
you:

- automate repetitive, boring, error-prone tasks
- create, maintain and analyse sustainable and reusable data
- work effectively with IT and systems colleagues
- better understand the use of software in research
- *and much more…*

Library Carpentry introduces you to the fundamentals of computing and provides you with a platform for further self-directed learning.

*Winner of the 2016 [British Library Labs](http://labs.bl.uk/British+Library+Labs+Awards) Teaching and Learning Award*

*We are delighted to have published findings from the initial Library Carpentry workshop in [LIBER Quarterly](http://doi.org/10.18352/lq.10176). See Baker, J. et al., (2016).
