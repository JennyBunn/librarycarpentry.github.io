What is Library Carpentry?
--------------------------

Library Carpentry is made **by librarians, for librarians** to help
you:

- automate repetitive, boring, error-prone tasks
- create, maintain and analyse sustainable and reusable data
- work effectively with IT and systems colleagues
- better understand the use of software in research
- *and much more…*

Library Carpentry introduces you to the fundamentals of computing and
provides you with a platform for further self-directed learning.
