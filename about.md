Library Carpentry is an exploratory programme of software skills training aimed at librarians. It takes the form of four three-hour introductory sessions is held at City University London between 1730 and 2030 on Monday the 9th, 16th, 23th, and 30th of November 2015 and hosted by the [Centre for Information Science](https://www.city.ac.uk/department-library-information-science/centre-for-information-science).

Library Carpentry is associated with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/), a non-profit volunteer organization whose members teach scientists basic software skills. Although not an official Software Carpentry programme of events, we sought approved from the Software Carpentry Committee to use the 'Carpentry' moniker and lessons learned from Library Carpentry will be fed back into the work of Software Carpentry.
