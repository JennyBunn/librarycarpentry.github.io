Library Carpentry is an exploratory programme of software skills training aimed at librarians. The initial incarnation was four three-hour introductory sessions held at City University London in November 2015 and hosted by the [Centre for Information Science](https://www.city.ac.uk/department-library-information-science/centre-for-information-science).

Library Carpentry is associated with [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/), a non-profit volunteer organization whose members teach scientists basic software skills. Although not an official Software Carpentry programme of events, we sought approved from the Software Carpentry Committee to use the 'Carpentry' moniker and lessons learned from Library Carpentry will be fed back into the work of Software Carpentry.
