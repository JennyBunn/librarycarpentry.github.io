Library Carpentry is in the commons and for the commons. It is not tied to any institution or person.

Library Carpentry is associated with and informally supported by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/), non-profit volunteer organization whose members teach scientists software and data science skills respectively.

Library Carpentry has received funding from the [Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/). The Software Sustainability Institute cultivates world-class research with software. The Institute is based at the universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Southampton and Oxford.

We are indebted to the [Centre for Information Science](https://www.city.ac.uk/department-library-information-science/centre-for-information-science) at City University London for agreeing to host the [first Library Carpentry programme](https://cradledincaricature.com/2015/12/01/library-carpentry-in-words-and-numbers-all-code-no-woodwork/) on November 2015.
